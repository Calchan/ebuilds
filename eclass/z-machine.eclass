# @BLURB: Install Infocom's Z-machine games.
# @DESCRIPTION:
# This eclass will automatically install Infocom's Z-machine games. Although
# considered abandoned by a lot of people these games are now owned by
# Activision. The user will thus have to buy the game, extract the
# corresponding .DAT file and place it in the system's distfiles location. All
# the developer has to do is, in the following order, set the GAME_DATA
# variable to the name of the .DAT file, import the z-machine eclass and then set
# the DESCRIPTION variable appropriately.
